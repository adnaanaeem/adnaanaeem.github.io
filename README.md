## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up your own personal resume.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to copy this project to your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Add Your Information

You have two options to add your personal information. Using the editor is recommended for its simplicity and to avoid syntax errors.

#### Option A: The Easy Way (Recommended) - Use the Resume Editor

The editor provides a user-friendly interface to generate your `resume.json` file without ever touching the code.

1.  **Go to the Resume Editor**: **[IMPORTANT: Link to your editor here]**
2.  **Fill out the form** with all your personal details, experience, skills, etc.
3.  Click the **"Generate & Download JSON"** button.
4.  Rename the downloaded file to `resume.json`.
5.  In your forked GitHub repository, upload this new `resume.json` file, replacing the existing one.

#### Option B: The Manual Way - Edit `resume.json` Directly

If you are comfortable with JSON, you can directly edit the `resume.json` file. This gives you full control and is great for quick updates.

*   **`meta`**: Contains all data for SEO and social sharing cards. Update the titles, descriptions, and URLs here.
*   **`name`, `title`**: Your full name and professional title.
*   **`contact`**: Your contact details.
*   **`sectionOrder`**: **Important!** This array controls the order of the sections on your resume. You can re-arrange or remove sections by editing this list.
*   **`summary`, `experience`, `skills`, `projects`, `education`**: These sections contain the main content of your resume. Follow the existing structure to add your own items.

### Step 3: Replace Personal Assets

*   **`profile.jpg`**: Replace this with your own professional headshot.
*   **`social-card.jpg`**: This is the image that appears when you share your link. Create a 1200x630 pixel image with your name, title, and photo. A free tool like Canva is perfect for this.

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Rename Your Repository**: For the best results, rename your forked repository to `yourusername.github.io` (replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username).
2.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   Navigate to the **Pages** section on the left.
    *   Under "Build and deployment," select the source as **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   Choose the `main` (or `master`) branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.
3.  **Done!** Your resume will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/` within a few minutes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (with Flexbox and Grid for layout)
